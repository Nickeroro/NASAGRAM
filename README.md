# NASAGRAM

API NASA + Instagram = ❤️

Website : 	http://www.nasagram.space
Website2 :	http://nasagram.pythonanywhere.com/

Bootstrap Template : https://tonycalvez.github.io/NASAGRAM/TEMPLATE-BOOTSTRAP/index.html 

### Introduction : 

My friend and I (Tony C & Nicolas TB) are studying embed systems as french engineers at the ENSTA-Bretagne. 

(Fun fact: our promotion sponsor is Jean-Loup Chrétien !)


We have deployed a django python powered website using your API as a basis, the project is called "NASAGRAM",


The main idea was to pick the photo of your choice from the Mars Rover Photos-API by clicking on a camera then be able to do some filtering on it (and share them with your friends).
